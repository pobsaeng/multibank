What's up guys, Today, I'm going to take about JavaScript frameworks.
It's one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks which is growing up quickly especially in 2018
and to make it become the library that developers most want to learn in 2018.

I have a few question to ask your guys.
-Who's been using Vue.js in here before? Just raise their hand.
-Who heard of Vue.js before but never use it? Just raise their hand.
Alright, there's a lot more people who have heard about it but never use it. 

Before we start, I just want to mention the important things of Vue.js
What is Vue.js?
Vue.js is a progressive web framework for building user interfaces and it's small size and faster, 
It also can be integrated with other frameworks built on JavaScript.
In this course, I'm going to show you exactly how you can writting Vue applications.
At first, We have to prepare our environment before to make it.
There are the different ways to try out Vue.js but so in this course,
I will bring you use two ways for testing Vue applications following:
- Using a CDN in a script tag.
- Using Vue-cli 
if you use CDN you can add directly include Vue via a CDN in a script tag in your project.
who is use the Vue-CLI you have to install Vue-CLI before use it.
(Using install Vue-CLI: go to command and open up so type "npm -g vue-cli --save" then enter it.)
